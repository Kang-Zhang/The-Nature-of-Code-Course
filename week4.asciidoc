[[week4_homework]]

== Homework Week 4

At this point we're a bit deeper in the semester and approaching the midterm project.  Feel free to simply start on a midterm idea or continue something you've been working on previously.  If you would like to try an exercise related to particle systems, here are some suggestions:

* Use a particle system in the design of a "Mover" object.  In other words take, say, one of our earlier examples and instead of rendering a Mover object as a simple circle, emit particles from the mover's location.  Consider using the http://www.shiffman.net/2011/02/13/asteroids-spaceship/[Asteroids] example and emit particles from the ship when a thrust force is applied.

* Create a particle system where the particles respond to each other via forces.  For example, what if you connect the particles with spring forces?  Or an attraction / repulsion force?

* Model a specific visual effect using a particle system -- fire, smoke, explosion, waterfall, etc.

* Create a simulation of an object shattering into many pieces.  How can you turn one large shape into thousands of small particles?

* Create a particle system in which each particle responds to every other particle.  (Note we'll be doing this in detail in Week 6.

* There are more exercise suggestions in Chapter 4.

As always, please create a web page to document your homework. Make sure it include some visual documentation of your work as well as the source code.
