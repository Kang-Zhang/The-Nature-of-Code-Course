== Homework Week 1

The exercises below are suggestions, for this first week's assignment a more open-ended wording might read: 
"Experiment with motion in Processing."

* Create a random walker with dynamic probabilities.  For example, can you give it a 50% chance of moving in the direction of the mouse?
*  Gaussian random walk is defined as one in which the step size (how far the object moves in a given direction) is generated with a normal distribution.  Implement this variation of our random walk.
* Try implementing the "self-avoiding walk": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk]
* Try implement the random walk known as a Levy Flight: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight]
* Try a walk in 3D: See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Cloud[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Cloud]
* Use the random walker as a template to simulate some real-world "natural" motion. Can you develop a set of rules for simulating that behavior?  Ideas: nervous fly, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc.  (Consider the challenge of using minimal visual design, i.e. b&w primitive shapes.  Can you give your "being" a personality?  Can it express emotions -- happiness, sadness, fear, etc.?  
* There are also more exercises in http://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/[The Nature of Code Introduction]

*You'll need to create a web page to document your homework.*  It could be as simple as the auto-generated page created by Processing's JavaScript mode.  It could also be a blog post or something custom you design.

*After completing and documenting your homework add a link to it below using "add comment."*  (Note you need to be logged into Chimera in order for this to work.  If you have trouble, don't worry, just e-mail me and we'll sort it out in class.)
