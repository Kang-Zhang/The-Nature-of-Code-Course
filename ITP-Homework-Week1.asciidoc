== Homework Week 1

The exercises below are suggestions, for this first week's assignment a more open-ended wording might read: 
"Experiment with motion in Processing."

* Take a look through the random walker examples (shared via dropbox, also https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code/tree/master/prologue[on github]).   Create your own (not so random?) walker.  Post a link to your work, as well as any thoughts on the above, on the http://itp.nyu.edu/varwiki/Nature/Nature[homework wiki]. Some ideas:
* Try implementing the "self-avoiding walk": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk]
* Try implement the random walk known as a Levy Flight: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9vy_flight]
* Try a walk in 3D: See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Cloud[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Cloud]
* Use the random walker as a template to simulate some real-world "natural" motion. Can you develop a set of rules for simulating that behavior?  Ideas: nervous fly, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc.  (Consider the challenge of using minimal visual design, i.e. b&w primitive shapes.  Can you give your "being" a personality?  Can it express emotions -- happiness, sadness, fear, etc.?  

You'll need to create a web page to document your homework.  It could be as simple as the auto-generated page created by Processing's JavaScript mode.  It could also be a blog post or something custom you design.

After completing and documenting your homework add a link to it below using "add comment."  (Note you need to be logged into Chimera in order for this to work.  If you have trouble, don't worry, just e-mail me and we'll sort it out in class.)
