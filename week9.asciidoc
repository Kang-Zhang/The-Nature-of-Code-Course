== Homework Week 9

For the remainder of this semester you should be working on your final project.  We'll do this in three stages.

1. Final Project Experimentation -- Create several quick and dirty sketches that implement the beginnings or seeds of an idea.
2. Final Project Proposal -- develop a plan and proposal.
3. Final Project -- Build the final project and present in class!

For your week 9 homework, you should be on step #2.  I'm also including some exercise ideas related to cellular automata below.

* Cellular Automata
** Combine CA with the flocking example -- what happens if you assign each boid a "state" which influences its behavior?
** Consider the state of a cell to be its color.  What types of image processing filters can you create using the principles of Cellular Automata?
** Develop your own rules for a Cellular Automata, 1D or 2D.   This could be something completely made up or a simulation of real-world phenomena.  For example, forest fires: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model]] or Predator, Prey [p. 191 of Computational Beauty of Nature.]
** Develop an alternative "Game of Life" with time as factor, i.e. what does it mean for a cell to be "alive" or "dead" for many frames in a row.
